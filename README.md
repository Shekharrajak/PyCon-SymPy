## About SymPy & SymEngine

SymPy is a pure Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external library.

SymEngine is a standalone fast C++ symbolic manipulation library. Optional thin wrappers allow usage of the library from other languages

## SymPy & SymEngine Tutorial for PyCon India 2017

This is the tutorial that SymPy developers will be giving at PyCon India 2017 for SymPy.
In this tutorial we will introduce attendees to SymPy, a computer aided algebra system (CAS) written in Python. We will show basics of constructing and manipulating mathematical expressions in SymPy, the most common issues and differences from other computer algebra systems, and how to deal with them. In the last part of this tutorial, we will show how to solve practical problems with SymPy. This will include showing how to interface SymPy with popular numeric libraries like NumPy.

Attendees will take home an introductory level understanding of SymPy. This knowledge should be enough for attendees to start using SymPy for solving mathematical problems and hacking SymPy's internals (though hacking core modules may require additional expertise).

## Proposal (will modify it and use it for pycon): 

In this tutorial we will introduce attendees to SymPy, a computer aided algebra system (CAS) written in Python. We will show basics of constructing and manipulating mathematical expressions in SymPy, the most common issues and differences from other computer algebra systems, and how to deal with them. We will mostly show how to solve practical problems with SymPy and SymEngine. This will include showing how to interface SymPy with popular numeric libraries like NumPy.

SymPy is a pure Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries. The tutorial will cover the following topics and more.

The tutorial will only assume a basic knowledge of Python. No prior knowledge of SymPy or other Python libraries is required, although it is suggested that attendees be familiar with the IPython notebook. A mathematical knowledge of calculus is recommended.

We recommend that the attendees install the Anaconda Python distribution which includes SymPy, NumPy, and IPython. Once Anaconda is installed simply type the following in a terminal to install the necessary packages:

`$ conda install numpy ipython-notebook sympy`

Other alternative installation instructions can be found here: http://docs.sympy.org/dev/install.html


SymPy team has developed and delivered many talks and tutorials at SciPy and other conferences. 
We are constantly building on new content and improving the present at the same time. 
The website for the workshop at PyCon India 2015 is here. 
You can find the introduction slides here, the sphinx tutorial here and the exercises in form of IPython notebooks here. 
Note: that the notebooks are hosted statically, you can download from here and run locally to have an interactive session.
